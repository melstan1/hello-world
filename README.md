The Classic First Repository Tutorial:

I am taking the tutorial to learn how to use GitHub. I live in Reno, NV  and am working on learning some new programming languages and  statistical methods. I would like to be a database administrator or a  data analyst. Someone told me recently there are too many people going into big data, but I already work for a big tech company, and it's my thought you work less when you love what you do, more.  Also, I am easily influenced by promises of tacos and kittns.
